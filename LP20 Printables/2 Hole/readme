Files for the 2 hole variant of the LP20 charge plug, like the one you woud get from DRI

"Nut holder" is a backing plate that holds your nuts in place, allowing for easy installation and removal of your LP20. I reccomend printing this in PLA/ PETG, high wall count to deal with the compression.
"Dust Cover" is a replacement dust cover that has been modified and thickened. I reccomend printing this in TPU, as all walls.
